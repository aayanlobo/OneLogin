providing feedback on the accuracy of the pattern and allowing the user to make
corrections as needed.

authentication to protect user data and prevent unauthorised access.
● User-friendly interface: The solution should have a user-friendly interface that is easy
to use, even for non-technical users, and accessible to users with disabilities.
